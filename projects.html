            <p>
                This is my very first official project, in which I have used <b> HTML, CSS & basic JavaScript. </b>
                <br><br>At the beggining I had problems using tables and got confused between tables and rows but after researching on Google I made few concepts clear and which helped  
                me making this calculator. <br><br>
                Talking about CSS, I love using my CSS skills whereever possible and I try to make it better and better for the best user experience.
                <br><br>
                When I was making this applicaton I had few weeks of JavaScript experience which was not enough so I had to give couple more weeks for JavaScript, which helped me making this Calculator Application.

                This is my second project, which I made using <b>HTML,CSS     (Bootstrap)</b> and a lot of <b>JavaScript.</b><br><br>
                While making this project I didn't know much how to give styles in HTML while attaching bootstrap CDN. But at the end I learned it and gave a basic structure to this Application.<br><br>
                Bootstrap was like a new CSS but much more simplier than it. It was fun when using bootstrap in your HTML and giving the bootstrap properties.<br><br>
                For this project I will say that I used a lot of JavaScript than I actually thought. Also, I managed to use <b>Object Oriented Programming(OOP) </b>in this app.

            <p>
                This project is personally my favourite one because I made it using<b> REACT</b>.<br><br>
                I found React much more easy than JavaScript, but I can't neglect that React contains basic fundamentals of JavaScript. I have used State hook in this project which made it simplier to built.<br><br>
                Also, now I am planning to make mobile application using<b> React Native.</b>
