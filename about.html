            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
               Learning to code has been a difficult and ardous journey for me, however, I have never done something so rewarding. Now I feel at a point where I can build multi-page websites with use of HTML & CSS skills. I am also experienced with JavaScript, functional programming and object oriented programming.  
            <br>
            <br>
                I am aware about fast growing modern industry, therefore I also learned React most recently and planning to learn Gatsby once I am a intermediate React user. Additionaly, I also have experince using SaSS and bootstrap tools which makes websites easier to built.
             <br>
             <br>
                I am a developer because I'm inspired to be a better me today than I was yesterday. I love to learn and built websites and I have attached my github projects in Projects section.
